# Prerequisites

This workshop requires several pacakges, which can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf", "tmap")
```

For Mac users, check out https://github.com/r-spatial/sf for additional tips if you run into errors when installing the **sf** package. Using homebrew to install **gdal** usually fixes any remaining issues.
